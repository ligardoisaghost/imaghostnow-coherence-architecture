# Documentation Layer Overview

The documentation layer provides the stable reference for the entire
IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.  
It ensures that every layer is interpretable, reproducible, and interoperable.

## Purpose

- Define the system at a formal reference level  
- Clarify interfaces between layers  
- Provide language, terminology, and style consistency  
- Act as the canonical source for external contributors  

## Structure

- `overview.md` — high-level purpose and documentation map  
- `specification.md` — formal definitions, grammar, and rules  
- `appendix.md` — diagrams, tables, enumerations, extended references  

## Notes

Documentation is *not* creative or exploratory; it is structured, stable, and exact.  
All language here should avoid metaphor unless explicitly defined.
