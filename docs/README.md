# IMAGHOSTNOW / docs

Docs are the **public-facing manual** of the organism.

## Intended audience

- future collaborators
- grant reviewers
- anyone arriving from GitHub, Substack, or papers

## Contents

- overview.md            – entrypoint into the project
- specification.md       – formal description of components
- appendix.md            – links out to theory, reports, datasets

Think of `docs/` as the lobby where outsiders first step in.
