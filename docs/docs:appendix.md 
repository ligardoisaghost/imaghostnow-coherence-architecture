| architecture | Components, interfaces, channels          |
| data         | Representations, schemas, mappings        |
| diagrams     | Visual system structures                  |

## B. File Conventions

- Markdown only  
- UTF-8 encoding  
- No trailing whitespace  
- No speculative content  
- All definitions must be cross-referenced

## C. Structural Constants

- Coherence must be preserved across:  
  - logical structure  
  - temporal cycles  
  - symbolic motifs
