# docs/appendix.md 

The appendix captures secondary or supporting material. It includes definitions, clarifications, out-of-band notes, and auxiliary tables. This file prevents clutter in the main documents. It cannot introduce new rules, only explain existing ones. Its role is to illuminate without expanding scope.
