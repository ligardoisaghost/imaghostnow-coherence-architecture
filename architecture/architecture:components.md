# Architecture Components

This file enumerates the major structural blocks of the IMAGHOSTNOW system.  
Each component is defined in terms of function, coherence role, and constraints.

## Core Components
- Root System  
- Algorithmic Layer  
- Data Layer  
- Creative Layer  
- Visual Layer  
- Phase Machine  
- Docs + Papers Layer  
- SRC (implementation hub)  

## Rules
- Components must remain decoupled but communicative  
- No component may violate coherence boundaries  
- Cross-layer operations must go through defined interfaces  

## Notes
If a new component is added, the architecture must be re-audited.
