# IMAGHOSTNOW / architecture

This layer defines the structural shape of the project: how concepts, datasets, and media relate.  
It is not about aesthetics; it is about load-bearing beams.

## Contents

- components.md  – major subsystems (coherence engine, narrative stack, data spine)
- overview.md    – high-level description of how everything fits together
- pipelines.md   – how information moves from raw inputs to public artifacts

## Purpose

Give any future reader (including you) one place to understand **how the system is built**,  
not just what it feels like.
