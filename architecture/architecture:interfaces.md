Architecture/interfaces.md

Interfaces define exactly how components speak: the shapes of inputs, the format of outputs, and the expectations between them. This prevents ambiguity in cross-layer communication. Each interface clarifies what may vary and what must remain constant. It describes permissible delays, transformations, and denormalizations. The file ensures every connection is clear enough to rebuild from scratch.
