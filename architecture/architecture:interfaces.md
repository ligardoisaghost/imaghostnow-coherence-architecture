# Architecture Interfaces

Interfaces define how layers communicate without breaking coherence.  
They establish allowed flows, forbidden interactions, and boundary logic.

## Purpose
- Protect system invariants  
- Enforce modularity  
- Reduce cross-layer noise  
- Stabilize long-term extensibility  

## Types of Interfaces
- Data-exchange contracts  
- Algorithmic ↔ Creative handshake  
- Root ↔ Phase coherence mapping  
- Visual ↔ Creative motif alignment  

## Notes
Interfaces are the shield. Breaking them breaks the entire structure.
