The architecture layer identifies every functional region of the system and describes the ecosystem they form together. It presents the system as a stack of responsibility zones unified by coherent rules. The overview explains why certain layers sit above or below others. It outlines the intent of the entire architecture: to produce stable, interpretable coherence readings. It clarifies what the architecture does not do, preventing scope creep.
