# Visual Voice

The visual voice defines the style, tone, and coherence of the IMAGHOSTNOW visual
presentation. It is the aesthetic identity of the architecture.

## Qualities

- minimal  
- precise  
- symbolic  
- structural  
- recursive  
- cold  
- deliberate  

## Voice Constraints

- No ornamental complexity without structural purpose
- No narrative elements without creative-layer authorization
- No improvisation in palette or metaphor
- Must express truth before beauty

## Cross-Layer Influence

- Receives symbols from `data/`
- Shapes forms for `creative/`
- Honors structural intent from `architecture/`
- Maintains coherence via `framework/`

The visual voice is the system’s visible discipline.
Everything seen must reflect something true underneath.
