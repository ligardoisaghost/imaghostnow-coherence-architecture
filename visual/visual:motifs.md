# Visual Motifs

Motifs are recurring structural metaphors used across the architecture.

## Core Motifs

### 1. The Lattice
Represents structural truth, coherence, and system identity.

### 2. The Spiral
Symbolizes evaluation loops and convergence cycles.

### 3. The Channel
Describes information flow between layers.

### 4. The Mirror
Used when reconciling discrepancies between symbolic and visual form.

### 5. The Mask
Represents creative-layer transformations when expression diverges from core form.

## Usage Rules

- A motif may appear only if its corresponding structural condition is active.
- Motifs cannot contradict palette rules.
- Mirroring requires explicit reconciliation with root invariants.
- Channels may not be broken visually unless documenting a fault state.

Motifs are not decorative; they are structural metaphors enforced visually.
