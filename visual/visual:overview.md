# Visual Overview

The visual layer defines how the architecture is perceived, interpreted, and communicated.  
This layer exists to ensure aesthetic coherence across diagrams, videos, symbols, and public-facing representations.

## Purpose
To unify IMAGHOSTNOW’s cinematic identity across mediums:  
video, diagrams, UI metaphors, glyphs, and symbolic interfaces.

## Contents
- **overview.md** — This file. Describes goals, tone, and visual philosophy.  
- **palette.md** — Defines the color logic, abstraction rules, and symbolic mapping.  
- **metaphors.md** — Provides the recurring visual devices used to explain complex systems.

## Notes
The visual layer does not dictate style.  
It dictates **coherence**.
