# Visual Layer Overview

The visual layer defines the aesthetic and metaphorical surface of the IMAGHOSTNOW system.
Where the data layer provides symbols, the visual layer provides the forms those
symbols can inhabit.

This layer determines:
- aesthetic constraints
- metaphor classes
- palette boundaries
- visual rhythm and structural pacing
- diagram-to-form translation rules
- sensory coherence across all rendered outputs

It bridges the semantic and perceptual domains, ensuring that all imagery remains
consistent with the deeper truth of the architecture.

## Responsibilities

- Receives symbolic mappings from `data/`
- Applies palette and metaphor constraints from this layer
- Interfaces with `creative/` for expressive transformation
- Preserves invariants from `framework/`
- Ensures diagrams remain faithful to canonical structure

The visual layer is not “art”; it is controlled form.
It governs what the system is allowed to *look like*.



# Visual Palette

The palette defines the allowed visual vocabulary of the system.  
Colors, luminance, geometry, and texture cues must align with structural meaning.

## 1. Core Palette

- Black: structure truth  
- White: signal clarity  
- Red: coherence violation  
- Blue: systemic law  
- Gold: invariant  
- Grey: transitional state  
- Yellow: activation threshold  
- Green: reconciliation  

These colors cannot be repurposed arbitrarily.  
Each has a fixed semantic binding.

## 2. Luminance Rules

- High contrast signifies structural prominence  
- Mid tones reflect transitional states  
- Low contrast indicates uncertainty or internal drift  

## 3. Geometry Constraints

- Sharp forms → logic  
- Curved forms → transition  
- Fractals → multi-layer recursion  
- Symmetry → structural stability  
- Asymmetry → evaluation cycles  

## 4. Forbidden Elements

- texture randomization  
- uncontrolled gradients  
- chaotic noise  
- freeform palettes  

The palette is strict.  
The visual layer is a gatekeeper, not a sandbox.
