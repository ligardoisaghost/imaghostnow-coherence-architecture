# Visual Metaphors

## Transmission Lines
Represent: data flow, coherence threads, synchronization.

## Nodes
Represent: subsystems, layers, invariant junctions.

## Ghost Layers
Soft gradients indicating uncertainty, drift, or ambiguity windows.

## Phase Gates
Harsh geometric cuts marking transitions between architectural layers.

## Notes
Metaphors remain consistent across visuals, diagrams, and videos.  
They ensure that every representation feels like it belongs to IMAGHOSTNOW.
