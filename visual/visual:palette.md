# Visual Palette

## Core Colors
- **Ghost White (#F8F8FF)** — Signal of clarity, edge, and computation.  
- **Deep Void Black (#000000)** — Ground state. Baseline.  
- **Neon Trace Red (#FF0033)** — Error, urgency, transformation.  
- **Cerulean Pulse (#00A6FF)** — Flow, transmission, coherence.

## Usage Rules
- White on black for root documentation.  
- Red only marks violations, risks, or invariants.  
- Blue marks flow, movement, or system health.

## Variants
Shades may interpolate, but never contradict purpose (flow, error, void, clarity).

## Notes
A palette is not decoration.  
It is the memory of the system.
