# IMAGHOSTNOW / core

Core is the invariant part of the organism: the rules that almost never change.

## What belongs here

- fundamental definitions (coherence, resonance, signal / noise)
- project axioms and constraints
- versioned "laws" of the Imaghostnow universe

If architecture is the skeleton, **core** is the DNA.
