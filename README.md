# IMAGHOSTNOW – Coherence Architecture

Working repository for the **IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture**:  
a structural blueprint for analyzing and constructing multi-modal coherence across
visual, sonic, linguistic, algorithmic, and life-cycle domains.

This repo is organized as a **stack of layers**.  
Each folder is a lens on the same system: root laws, abstract framework, algorithms,
data, diagrams, visuals, creative voice, research papers, operational notes, and
implementation pipelines.

---

## Root Layer

**Directory:** `root/`  

Defines the **identity, invariants, and ground truth** of the architecture.

- `root/overview.md` – What the root is, what it protects, how everything anchors to it.  
- `root/principles.md` – Core non-negotiable principles and philosophy.  
- `root/structure.md` – How layers, stacks, and relationships are organized.  
- `root/invariants.md` – Things that must never change if coherence is to hold.  
- `root/flows.md` – Fundamental flows and cross-layer channels.

Everything else in this repo is required to stay consistent with the root.

---

## Framework Layer

**Directory:** `framework/`  

Abstract **architecture skeleton**: layers, invariants, and system-level perspective.

- `framework/overview.md` – High-level definition of the framework layer.  
- `framework/layers.md` – Description of each major layer and how they stack.  
- `framework/invariants.md` – Structural rules that remain fixed as the system evolves.

Framework = shape of the system. Algorithms, data, and visuals must fit inside it.

---

## Algorithmic Layer

**Directory:** `algorithmic/`  

Defines the **computational behavior** of the architecture.

- `algorithmic/overview.md` – What “algorithmic coherence” means in this system.  
- `algorithmic/logic.md` – Core logic rules, operators, and evaluation constraints.  
- `algorithmic/flows.md` – State machines, evaluation loops, and decision flows.

This is where coherence becomes something you can actually compute and test.

## Data & Diagram Layers

**Directories:** `data/`, `diagrams/`  

How information is represented and visualized.

**Data (`data/`):**

- `data/overview.md` – What counts as data in this system.  
- `data/schemas.md` – Canonical schemas, fields, and contracts.  
- `data/flows.md` – How data moves between components and layers.

**Diagrams (`diagrams/`):**

- `diagrams/overview.md` – Diagram philosophy and conventions.  
- `diagrams/system_map.md` – High-level system map of IMAGHOSTNOW.  
- `diagrams/pipelines.md` – Ingestion, processing, and output pipelines.

These two layers make the structure and motion visible.

---

## Visual & Creative Layers

**Directories:** `visual/`, `creative/`  

The **aesthetic identity** and creative rules of the system.

**Visual (`visual/`):**

- `visual/overview.md` – Visual language and coherence rules.  
- `visual/palette.md` – Color, tone, texture, and light guidelines.  
- `visual/metaphors.md` – Recurring visual motifs and symbols.

**Creative (`creative/`):**

- `creative/overview.md` – Overall creative stance and constraints.  
- `creative/voice.md` – Narrative voice, tone, and perspective.  
- `creative/motifs.md` – Recurring story and thematic elements.

These files keep the visuals and storytelling aligned with the architecture instead of drifting.

---

## Papers & Docs

**Directories:** `papers/`, `docs/`  

Where this architecture is turned into **formal writing**.

**Papers (`papers/`):**

- `papers/overview.md` – How research outputs relate to the architecture.  
- `papers/whitepaper.md` – Core whitepaper describing IMAGHOSTNOW as a system.  
- `papers/research_agenda.md` – Open questions, experiments, and research tracks.

**Docs (`docs/`):**

- `docs/overview.md` – Practical documentation entry point.  
- `docs/specification.md` – System specification and behavioral contracts.  
- `docs/appendix.md` – Tables, references, and supporting material.

---

## Phase & Lifecycle Layer

**Directory:** `phase/`  

Tracks **states, cycles, and operational phases** of the project.

- `phase/overview.md` – What “phase” means in this architecture.  
- `phase/states.md` – Canonical system and project states.  
- `phase/cycles.md` – Repeating loops, release cycles, and learning cycles.

---

## Source & Implementation

**Directory:** `src/`  

This is where implementation details live when code or scripts are added.

- `src/overview.md` – How to interpret and extend the source layer.  
- `src/core.md` – Core primitives, modules, or pseudo-code.  
- `src/pipelines.md` – Implementation view of ingestion, processing, and output flows.

Currently this is architectural and conceptual; code can grow here without breaking coherence.

---

## Notes

**Directory:** `notes/`  

Working memory and operational log.

- `notes/overview.md` – How to use this notes layer.  
- `notes/changelog.md` – Human-readable change history.  
- `notes/todos.md` – Active tasks and next steps.  
- `notes/TODO.md` – Quick scratchpad for immediate work.

## Architecture Index

For navigation from the top level:

- `root/` – Identity & invariants  
- `framework/` – Abstract structure  
- `algorithmic/` – Logic & flows  
- `data/` – Schemas & data movement  
- `diagrams/` – Maps & visual pipelines  
- `visual/` – Visual identity  
- `creative/` – Narrative & motifs  
- `papers/` – Formal research

- `phase/` – States & cycles  
- `src/` – Implementation surface  
- `notes/` – Operational notes and tasks

This architecture is meant to be extended.  
New layers, tools, or repos should either:

1. Attach to one of these existing layers, **or**  
2. Justify a new layer in terms of root principles and framework invariants.
