# IMAGHOSTNOW – Coherence Architecture

Working repo for coherence system diagrams, notes, and research.A structural blueprint for analyzing and constructing multi-modal coherence across visual, sonic, linguistic, and algorithmic domains.

This repository documents the frameworks, pattern systems, and architectural primitives underlying the imaghostnow creative research corpus.

It is not a portfolio.  
It is not a narrative.  
It is an architecture.

# System Overview

This document introduces:
- the cross-modal coherence model
- the multi-universe visual taxonomy
- sonic-to-visual mapping structures
- algorithmic fingerprint frameworks
- pattern-convergence scaffolding
- emergent behavior within creative systems

This repo represents an ongoing research effort.
