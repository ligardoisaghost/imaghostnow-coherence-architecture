# IMAGHOSTNOW – Coherence Architecture

A multi-layer structural blueprint for coherence across diagrams, systems, flows, states, and narrative design.

## Layer Map

- **root/**  
  Identity, invariants, coherence laws, structure, fundamental flows.

- **framework/**  
  Rules, constraints, correctness, systemic intent.

- **algorithmic/**  
  Operators, logic, evaluators.

- **data/**  
  Schemas, representations, systemic mapping.

- **diagrams/**  
  System maps, pipelines, visual coherence.

- **architecture/**  
  Structural channels, components, interfaces.

- **visual/**  
  Palette, motifs, voice.

- **creative/**  
  Expression, narrative, stylistic coherence.

- **phase/**  
  States, cycles, transitions.

- **src/**  
  Practical implementation blueprint.

- **docs/**  
  Specification, appendix, governance.

- **papers/**  
  Conceptual expansions, research layers, higher-order states.

- **notes/**  
  Changelog, open questions, todos.

## Purpose

To maintain stable coherence as systems grow, evolve, and interact.  
No layer drifts, no hidden change escapes reconciliation, no update breaks structural truth.
