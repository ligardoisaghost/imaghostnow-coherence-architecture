# Data Pipelines

The data layer defines symbolic sequences that ensure meaning travels coherently
through the system.

## 1. Symbol Encoding Pipeline

1. receive structure  
2. assign canonical symbol  
3. validate against root invariants  
4. apply framework constraints  
5. bind symbolic metadata  
6. register with diagrams layer  

Rules:
- symbols cannot contradict structural shape  
- missing metadata invalidates the pipeline  

## 2. Symbolic-to-Visual Translation

Stages:
1. match symbol to form class  
2. resolve palette constraints  
3. map onto diagram geometry  
4. prepare metaphor surface  
5. send to visual layer  

## 3. Validation and Reconciliation

Triggered when:
- diagram mismatch  
- invalid translation  
- contradictory symbol  
- orphan node or edge  

Cycle:
1. locate mismatch  
2. compare to canonical symbol  
3. reapply constraints  
4. correct diagrams  
5. update structure reference  

The data layer is the silent adjudicator:  
nothing advances unless the symbols agree with the truth.
