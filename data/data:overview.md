# Data Layer Overview

The data layer defines how information is stored, structured, and accessed within the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.

## Purpose
This layer creates the memory substrate for all modules. It defines how data flows, how it is validated, and how it persists.

## Contents
- **overview.md** — Describes purpose and scope of the data layer.
- **schemas.md** — Defines structures, formats, and data types.
- **flows.md** — Describes ingestion, validation, and coherence-preserving flow rules.

## Notes
The data layer acts as the stabilizing memory field.  
All higher layers rely on its consistency and integrity.
