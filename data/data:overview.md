# Data Layer Overview

The data layer defines the symbolic backbone of the IMAGHOSTNOW system.
Where diagrams provide visuals, the data layer provides the canonical forms
those visuals map to.

This layer is responsible for:
- symbolic representations of structure
- translation schemas between layers
- canonical definitions of nodes, edges, shapes, and flows
- validation of diagram correctness
- ensuring coherence between symbolic and visual models

## Cross-Layer Responsibilities

- Receives structure definitions from `root/` and `framework/`
- Interprets logic states from `algorithmic/`
- Advances structural channels defined in `architecture/`
- Provides mapping rules for `diagrams/`
- Supplies symbolic anchors for `visual/` metaphors
- Ensures creative transformations remain coherent

The data layer is the enforcement mechanism that ensures every visual or narrative form has a grounded, canonical source-definition.
