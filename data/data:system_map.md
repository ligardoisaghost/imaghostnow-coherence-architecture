# Data System Map

This document defines the symbolic interpretation of the global system map.

## Symbolic Elements

Nodes:
- T (truth)
- L (law)
- G (logic)
- S (structure)
- M (symbol)
- F (form)
- E (expression)
- C (cycle)

Edges:
- → enforce  
- → evaluate  
- → translate  
- → constrain  
- → expose  
- → refine  

## Canonical Mapping

### Root → Framework
T → L  
Truth symbols enforce system law.

### Framework → Algorithmic
L → G  
Law generates logic constraints.

### Algorithmic → Architecture
G → S  
Logic manifests as pathways and channel structure.

### Architecture → Data
S → M  
Structure becomes symbolic form.

### Data → Visual
M → F  
Symbols project into form and metaphor.

### Visual → Creative
F → E  
Forms transform into expression.

### Creative → Phase
E → C  
Expression becomes versioned cycles.

This mapping is the authoritative translation of the system map into its symbolic, machine-grounded form.
