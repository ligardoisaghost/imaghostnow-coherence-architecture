The system map describes data flow at the atlas scale. It charts upstream origins, midstream transformations, and downstream consumption. It includes bottlenecks, invariants, and safety checks. This file exposes the entire metabolism of the data layer. It makes the complexity transparent enough for debugging or theoretical inspection.
