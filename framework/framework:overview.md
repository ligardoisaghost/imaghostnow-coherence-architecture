#framework/overview.md

This file establishes the conceptual framework: the philosophical and structural assumptions behind the system. It explains why the coherence model takes this form rather than another. It identifies the system’s grounding invariants. It prevents misinterpretation by clarifying what the framework is not. This is the lens through which the rest of the architecture is understood.
