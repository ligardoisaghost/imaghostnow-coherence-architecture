# Framework Overview

The framework defines the structural blueprint of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.  
Where the root sets identity and principles, the framework specifies *how those principles must be implemented*.

This layer ensures:

- every component has a defined place  
- every layer has a defined boundary  
- cross-layer movement follows explicit rules  
- coherence can be verified structurally  

The framework is the “skeleton” of the system.  
If the root is the constitution, the framework is the legal code.

## Responsibilities

- Define each layer in the system  
- Specify inter-layer contracts  
- Declare legal and illegal cross-layer interactions  
- Provide a schema for reconciliation of changes  
- Ensure no component drifts outside its assigned boundary

## Cross-Layer Constraints

The framework enforces:

- `root/` → must anchor all other layers  
- `framework/` → must describe the full layer topology  
- `algorithmic/` → must follow framework logic rules  
- `architecture/` → must instantiate framework-defined relationships  
- `src/` → must not violate structural boundaries  
- `visual/` + `creative/` → must express structure faithfully  
- `phase/` → must track temporal changes in a framework-consistent way

Framework violations are treated as *structural faults* and must be corrected immediately.
