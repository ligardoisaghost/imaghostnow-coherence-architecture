# Global Invariants

These invariants define the non-negotiable rules of the IMAGHOSTNOW architecture.  
They apply to every layer, every subsystem, every file.

---

## 1. Coherence Cannot Contradict Coherence
No subsystem may generate a rule or behavior that violates a previously established coherence law.

## 2. Lower Layers Are Sovereign
Root → Framework → Phase → Visual → Algorithmic → Creative  
Higher layers must follow the logic of the layers beneath them.

## 3. Representation Must Follow Structure
A visual, text, or sonic artifact cannot contradict the structural model it is based on.

## 4. All Systems Must Be Explainable
Every part of the architecture must be interpretable:  
black-box behavior is forbidden.

## 5. The Architecture Is Expanding, Not Arbitrary
Layers grow in complexity over time,  
but they must always preserve root definitions and framework logic.

## 6. No Silent Drift
Any update to the architecture must be tracked, documented, and justified.
