# Architecture Layers

The IMAGHOSTNOW architecture consists of five primary layers:

---

## 1. Logic Layer
Defines the laws of coherence, symbolic structure, invariants, and reasoning patterns.

## 2. Structural Layer
Defines subsystem shapes, roles, dependencies, and allowable communication patterns.

## 3. Behavioral Layer
Defines system movement: interaction models, update cycles, transformations, and flows.

## 4. Representational Layer
Defines how concepts manifest visually, textually, sonically, and symbolically.

## 5. Execution Layer
Defines real-time constraints, performance requirements, and system-level integration rules.

---

## Cross-Layer Law
A lower layer **may depend on** a higher layer,  
but a higher layer **may never contradict** a lower layer.

This guarantees stability throughout the architecture.
