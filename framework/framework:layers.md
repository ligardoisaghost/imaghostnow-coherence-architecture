# Framework Layer Definitions

This document defines every layer in the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture,  
including its purpose, scope, and structural relationships.

## Root Layer
Purpose: identity, principles, invariants, canonical flows.  
Scope: defines truth for the entire architecture.

## Framework Layer (this layer)
Purpose: establish structural rules, constraints, and layer schema.

## Algorithmic Layer
Purpose: encode dynamic system behavior, logic rules, evaluators, thresholds.  
Input: framework structure  
Output: coherent decisions, state transitions, operators.

## Data Layer
Purpose: provide observable evidence and measurable signals.

## Diagrams Layer
Purpose: generate system maps, state graphs, and coherence charts.

## Architecture Layer
Purpose: design concrete components, interfaces, pathways.  
This is where abstract logic becomes implemented structure.

## Visual Layer
Purpose: ensure visual consistency and semantic alignment.

## Creative Layer
Purpose: narrative coherence, motif control, aesthetic tone.

## Papers Layer
Purpose: formal explanations, research agenda, whitepaper.

## Phase Layer
Purpose: temporal progression, lifecycle control, state machines.

## Source Layer (src/)
Purpose: operational implementation; must comply with all above layers.

Each layer MUST reference the one above it and MUST NOT contradict it.
