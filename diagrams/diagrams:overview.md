# Diagrams Overview

The diagrams layer provides the visual geometry of the IMAGHOSTNOW system.
It converts structure, logic, and flows into interpretable maps.

Diagrams ensure:
- coherence relationships remain visible
- cross-layer dependencies can be reasoned about
- flows and states can be verified visually
- systemic drift is detectable at a glance

## Diagram Types

### 1. System Map
High-level overview of root, framework, algorithmic, architecture, creative,
visual, and phase interactions.

### 2. Flow Graphs
Show directed pathways of signal propagation, state transitions, and coherence cycles.

### 3. Structure Schematics
Illustrate nodes, channels, surfaces, and lattice constraints.

### 4. Pipelines
Depict sequential or cyclical stages such as:
- signal evaluation loop
- coherence alignment cycle
- cross-layer reconciliation

## Cross-Layer Inputs

Diagrams draw from:
- `root/structure.md`
- `framework/layers.md`
- `algorithmic/flows.md`
- `architecture/components.md`
- `creative/motifs.md`
- `visual/palette.md`

A diagram is valid only if every referenced element exists in its parent layer.
