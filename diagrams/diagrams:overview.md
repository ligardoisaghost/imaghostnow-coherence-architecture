# Diagrams Overview

This folder contains structural maps of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.

Diagrams in this layer do not invent new logic.
They *visualize* structures that are defined in the root, framework, algorithmic, and data layers.

## Purpose

- Provide fast visual orientation for new readers.
- Show how systems interact without requiring deep code or text.
- Anchor conversations around stable shapes: graphs, grids, flows, stacks.
