Diagrams/palette #

The palette defines the symbolic color, shape, and line choices used in diagrams. This ensures visual coherence across documents and phases. The file documents the meaning behind each visual choice. It also sets boundaries: which variations are allowed and which dilute meaning. The palette acts as the visual language of the architecture.
