# Phase Layer Overview

The phase layer defines temporal structure within the IMAGHOSTNOW architecture.
It governs how the system moves through operational states, transitions, and
cyclical patterns.

Where the root defines truth, and the framework defines structure,  
the phase layer defines *time*.

## Responsibilities

- Track system temporal modes  
- Define allowable transitions  
- Prevent illegal state drift  
- Provide rhythm for evaluation cycles  
- Regulate when coherence checks are triggered  

## Temporal Domains

- **Static Phase** — unchanged configuration  
- **Dynamic Phase** — controlled evolution  
- **Transitional Phase** — system shifts requiring reconciliation  
- **Restorative Phase** — rollback or re-stabilization  

No phase may occur outside declared boundaries.  
Temporal drift is considered a structural fault.
