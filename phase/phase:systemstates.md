# System States

System states define discrete modes of operation that the architecture may enter.

## Canonical States

### 1. Initialization
The system loads core principles, invariants, and structural boundaries.

### 2. Evaluation
Signals, diagrams, and coherence metrics are analyzed and weighted.

### 3. Expression
Creative and visual layers apply sanctioned transformation.

### 4. Stabilization
Results are reconciled against root truth and structural invariants.

### 5. Propagation
Outputs move outward to dependent layers or external systems.

## State Rules

- No creative or visual transformation may occur before evaluation  
- Propagation requires stabilization confirmation  
- Initialization must reload the root layer every time  
- System states cannot be skipped or inverted
