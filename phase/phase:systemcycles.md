# System Cycles

Cycles define repeatable temporal patterns that maintain global coherence.

## Core Cycles

### 1. Coherence Cycle
- Evaluate signals  
- Compare against invariants  
- Resolve drift  
- Re-stabilize  

### 2. Expression Cycle
- Interpret symbolic input  
- Apply creative/visual transformation  
- Validate against structure  
- Publish or propagate results  

### 3. Drift Correction Cycle
- Detect anomaly  
- Trace to source layer  
- Issue correction  
- Re-test coherence  

### 4. Regeneration Cycle
- Rebuild weakened structures  
- Re-align motifs and diagrams  
- Reset state thresholds  
- Return to stabilized phase  

## Cycle Constraints

- No cycle may produce transformation without verification  
- Cycles must conclude with a stabilization check  
- Failed cycles must trigger restorative phase  

Cycles are the rhythm that protects the architecture from collapse.
