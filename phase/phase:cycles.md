# System Cycles

Cycles define the rhythmic, periodic, or repeating patterns of the architecture.

## Core Cycles
- **Ingestion Cycle** — New data enters. Normalizes. Integrates.
- **Alignment Cycle** — Subsystems synchronize. Conflicts resolved.
- **Expansion Cycle** — Architecture grows, adds layers, deepens structure.
- **Refinement Cycle** — Cleanup, pruning, optimization.

## Cycle Rules
- Cycles must always return to Alignment before restarting.
- Cycles cannot skip forward without completing their current stage.
- Overlapping cycles require explicit justification in documentation.

## Notes
Cycles allow the architecture to evolve while keeping coherence intact.
