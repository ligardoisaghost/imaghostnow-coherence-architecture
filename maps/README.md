# IMAGHOSTNOW / maps

Maps are visual and conceptual diagrams:
how ideas, people, datasets, and timelines connect.

## Examples

- diagrams/system_map.rtf
- diagrams/pipelines.md
- relationship graphs
- timelines and phase diagrams

Maps should make it possible to onboard a completely new mind  
without them needing to read every document.
