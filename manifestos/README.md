# IMAGHOSTNOW / manifestos

This is where you talk like a human with teeth.

Use this layer for:

- project manifestos
- creative declarations
- statements of intent for new phases
- "why this exists" documents

It is deliberately subjective and emotional.  
Later, theory will cool it down. Here, you speak freely.
