# Algorithmic Flows

These flows govern the movement of signals, states, and evaluations  
across the architecture.

## Canonical Flows

### 1. Coherence Propagation
Evaluates coherence from the root downward, ensuring that any change  
retains semantic fidelity and structural intent.

### 2. State Evaluation Loop
A continuous cycle:
- read current state  
- apply logic operators  
- compute deviations  
- update system state  

### 3. Signal Alignment Pass
Validates whether incoming signals (from visual, data, creative layers)  
align with system expectations.

### 4. Cross-Layer Reconciliation Cycle
Triggered when:
- structural violation  
- coherence drop  
- threshold failure  
- logic mismatch  

Runs reconciliation through:  
`algorithmic → framework → root`.

## Cross-Layer Links

- `data/` provides signals  
- `diagrams/` produces structural models  
- `framework/` enforces constraints  
- `architecture/` provides structural channels  
- `src/` executes resolved behavior

Algorithmic flows define dynamic truth.  
Truth is meaningless without motion.
