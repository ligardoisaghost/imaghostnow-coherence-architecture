# Algorithmic Overview

The algorithmic layer defines the computational behavior of the IMAGHOSTNOW architecture.  
Where the framework establishes structure, the algorithmic layer governs *how the system thinks, evaluates, and adapts*.

## Purpose

- Maintain coherence dynamically  
- Evaluate alignment between layers  
- Perform signal weighting  
- Apply pattern and threshold logic  
- Manage state transitions  
- Execute internal feedback loops

## Core Responsibilities

- Interpret structural rules from `framework/`  
- Apply canonical logic from `algorithmic/logic.md`  
- Execute flows from `algorithmic/flows.md`  
- Report coherence deviations  
- Trigger reconciliation cycles when rules break

## Notes

The algorithmic layer is active logic.  
Changes here affect system-wide behavior and must be reconciled against:

- `root/principles.md`  
- `framework/layers.md`  
- `architecture/components.md`

Algorithmic drift = systemic drift.
