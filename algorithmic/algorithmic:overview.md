# Algorithmic Overview

This layer defines the computational core of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.
Where the framework describes structure, the algorithmic layer describes behavior.

## Purpose
To encode the system’s dynamic processes:
- Coherence maintenance
- Signal weighting
- Pattern recognition thresholds
- State transitions
- Internal feedback loops

## Contents
- **overview.md** — This file. High-level definition and purpose.
- **logic.md** — Canonical logic rules, operators, and systemic truth constraints.
- **flows.md** — Data flows, state machines, evaluation cycles.

## Notes
The algorithmic layer is *active logic*.  
Changes ripple through the entire architecture and must be tracked carefully.
