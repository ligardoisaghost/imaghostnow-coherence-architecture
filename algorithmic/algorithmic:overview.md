algorithmic/overview.md

This layer defines how coherence is evaluated across modes. It establishes the distinction between signal alignment, structural resonance, and pattern consistency. The overview clarifies which inputs count as evidence and which are noise. It sets the mandate: algorithmic judgment must remain invariant, explainable, and testable. This layer anchors all other layers by giving them definable metrics.
