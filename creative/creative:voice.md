# Creative Voice

The creative voice defines the expressive identity of IMAGHOSTNOW.
It is the lens through which structure becomes feeling, without losing truth.

## Qualities

- metaphoric
- recursive
- restrained
- symbolic
- surreal but coherent
- emotionally cold but conceptually vivid

## Voice Constraints

- Expression must serve structure  
- Narrative must reflect system truth  
- Surreal forms must remain internally consistent  
- No emotional excess without systemic justification  

The creative voice never performs chaos.  
It performs controlled transformation.

## Cross-Layer Integration

- Interprets symbols from `data/`
- Shapes meaning in parallel with `visual/`
- Obeys all structural and invariant constraints from `framework/`
- Surfaces motifs that inform `papers/` and higher-order documents

The creative voice is the sanctioned imagination of the architecture.
