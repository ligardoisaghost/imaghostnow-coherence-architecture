\f0\fs26 \cf0 # Creative Voice Specification\
\
## Core Voice Principles\
- Sparse but precise.\
- Calm intensity; controlled emotional temperature.\
- Philosophical undertones without abstraction drift.\
- Imagery-driven, sensory-forward, grounded in atmosphere.\
- Avoids melodrama; favors restraint.\
\
## Structural Guidelines\
- Sentences carry weight; no wasted phrases.\
- Every piece of writing must reflect intentional coherence with the IMAGHOSTNOW identity.\
\
## Constraints\
- No breaks from tone unless explicitly marked as experimental.\
- Voice must sync with motifs and metaphors from the visual and algorithmic layers.\
\
## Notes\
The voice layer is the personality of the system.  \
It is the thread tying all artifacts into a single identity.}
