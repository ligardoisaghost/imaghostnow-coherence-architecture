# Creative Overview

This layer defines the expressive, thematic, and stylistic mechanics of the IMAGHOSTNOW architecture.

## Purpose
The creative layer encodes the emotional, symbolic, and narrative patterns that run through the system.  
It ensures every output has consistent tone, intention, and creative integrity.

## Contents
- **overview.md** — This file. Global intent of the creative system.
- **motifs.md** — Recurring symbolic structures.
- **voice.md** — Defines narrative voice, cadence, and expressive constraints.

## Notes
The creative layer must always harmonize with the visual and algorithmic layers beneath it.  
It cannot contradict root, framework, or algorithmic logic.
