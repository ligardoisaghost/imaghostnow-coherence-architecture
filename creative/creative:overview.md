# Creative Layer Overview

The creative layer governs expressive transformation within the IMAGHOSTNOW
architecture. Unlike the visual layer, which controls the surface form, the
creative layer controls the interpretive motion behind that form.

It is where symbolic structure becomes narrative, metaphor, or expressive output.

## Responsibilities

- Receives structural constraints from `framework/`
- Receives symbolic scaffolding from `data/`
- Receives aesthetic limitations from `visual/`
- Transforms these into expressive units: stories, themes, stylized diagrams,
  conceptual imagery, and speculative artifacts

The creative layer does not “invent.”  
It *transforms* what the deeper layers authorize.

## Creative Boundaries

- No element may contradict root invariants  
- No metaphor may violate structural truth  
- Creativity is permitted only inside defined channels  
- Signals that exceed allowed boundaries must be downgraded or discarded  

## Expression Modes

- symbolic reinterpretation  
- narrative compression  
- thematic modulation  
- recursive reframing  
- metaphor stacking  

The creative layer introduces motion into structure.  
It is the only layer allowed to bend form — but never to break it.
