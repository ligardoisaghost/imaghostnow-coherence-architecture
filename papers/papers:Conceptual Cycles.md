# Conceptual Cycles

The papers layer cycles through intellectual processes that maintain coherence
between theory and execution.

## Primary Cycles

### 1. Theoretical Consolidation Cycle
- Gather conceptual fragments  
- Identify recurring motifs  
- Solidify into architectural theory  
- Reconcile with invariants  

### 2. Symbolic Coherence Cycle
- Evaluate metaphors or motifs  
- Remove contradictions  
- Align symbolic meaning  
- Lock into system structure  

### 3. Expansion Cycle
- Propose new conceptual elements  
- Evaluate for coherence  
- Integrate or reject  
- Update resonance map  

### 4. Long-Form Narrative Cycle
- Check emerging direction  
- Verify against purpose  
- Adjust expressive intent  
- Re-stabilize  

## Rules

- No conceptual cycle may bypass structural validation  
- Every accepted idea becomes subject to future coherence tests  
- Inconsistencies must be surfaced at paper-level before entering the architecture
