# Research Agenda

This document tracks open questions, unresolved structures, and long-term lines of inquiry.

## Foundational Questions
- How does coherence propagate across layers?
- What conditions break coherence?
- How do motifs evolve without violating the invariants?

## Technical Questions
- Can subsystem flows be optimized into a generative pattern engine?
- How can the architecture be used to predict algorithmic behavior?

## Creative Questions
- What additional motifs or metaphors strengthen system identity?
- How does visual logic integrate with sonic identity?

## Long-Term Lines of Inquiry
- Formalizing coherence as an algorithm.  
- Encoding the architecture into automated tooling.  
- Expanding the system into external research domains.

## Status
Active, ongoing, expanding.
