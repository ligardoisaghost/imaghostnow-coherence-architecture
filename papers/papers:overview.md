# Papers Overview

This folder contains the formal written works that articulate, justify, and extend the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.  
These documents are high-signal, deeply reasoned, and grounded in the system’s invariants.

## Purpose
The papers layer serves as the intellectual backbone of the architecture.  
Each paper converts architecture into explanation, into philosophy, into public doctrine.

## Contents
- **overview.md** — This file.  
- **whitepaper.md** — Core conceptual and technical document describing the architecture.  
- **research_agenda.md** — Open questions, long-term inquiries, and future lines of analysis.
