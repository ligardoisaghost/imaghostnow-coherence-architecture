# Papers Layer Overview

The papers layer contains formal documents that articulate the theory,
rationale, and philosophical grounding of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.

It serves as the intellectually rigorous spine behind the operational layers.

## Responsibilities

- Develop conceptual frameworks  
- Formalize coherence principles  
- Provide theoretical justification  
- Define narrative and semiotic context  
- Clarify long-range research directions  

## Document Types

- Whitepapers  
- Research notes  
- Concept essays  
- Architectural arguments  
- Symbolic analysis  

The papers layer exists to ensure the system has depth, structure, and meaning
beyond mechanics. Without it, coherence collapses into technique without intent.
