# Conceptual States

These are the philosophical modes the architecture may inhabit while reasoning
about creativity, structure, and coherence.

## Foundational States

### 1. Structural Reflection
The system re-examines its own form, boundaries, and constraints.

### 2. Symbolic Inquiry
The system inspects meaning, metaphor, and semiotic mapping.

### 3. Narrative Intention
The architecture aligns expression with internal truth and long-form direction.

### 4. Meta-Coherence State
Cross-checking the architecture’s internal logic against its conceptual aims.

### 5. Interpretive Expansion
System allows controlled growth of new motifs or metaphors.

## Constraints

- No new concept may violate a root invariant  
- Symbolic expansion must be cross-evaluated against structure  
- Narrative intention cannot override fundamental flows
