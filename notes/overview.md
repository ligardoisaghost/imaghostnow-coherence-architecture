# Notes Layer Overview

The notes layer tracks real-time evolution of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.
It acts as the active memory of the system, capturing decisions, drafts,
observations, and operational details that do not yet belong to formal layers.

## Responsibilities

- Track architectural updates  
- Maintain reasoning trails  
- Log unresolved questions  
- Hold drafts and scratch conceptual fragments  
- Provide a buffer before material enters formal papers or framework  

## Structure

- `changelog.md` — versioned change history  
- `todos.md` — upcoming tasks, missing pieces, pending reconciliations  
- `overview.md` — this file, stating purpose and function  

Nothing in the notes layer is permanent. Every item must either be resolved,
discarded, or promoted to a higher layer.
