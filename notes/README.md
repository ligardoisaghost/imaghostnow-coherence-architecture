# IMAGHOSTNOW / notes

This is the scratchpad layer: fragments, half-formed ideas,  
working sessions, and terminal logs that aren’t ready for theory or core.

## Rules

- Anything can land here.
- Nothing here is sacred.
- When something stabilises, it graduates to `core`, `theory`, or `docs`.

Notes are allowed to be ugly. They just aren’t allowed to go missing.
