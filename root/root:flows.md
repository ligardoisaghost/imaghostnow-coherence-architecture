# Fundamental Flows

These flows govern how information, state, and signals move through the system.

## Canonical Flows
- Coherence propagation
- State evaluation loop
- Signal alignment pass
- Cross-layer reconciliation cycle

## Cross-Layer Links
algorithmic/: implements flows as operators and evaluators.
data/: maps flows into systemic diagrams.
framework/: enforces flow correctness.
architecture/: provides the structural channels flows travel through.
