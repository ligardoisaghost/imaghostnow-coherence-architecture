# Root Overview

This folder defines the foundational structure, assumptions, and orientation of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.

## Purpose
The root layer establishes the global definitions that every subsystem depends on. Nothing in the system can contradict the root files.

## Contents
- **overview.md** — This file. Describes purpose, structure, orientation.
- **structure.md** — Defines architectural layers and global invariants.
- **principles.md** — Core logic rules, coherence laws, and non-negotiable constraints.

## Notes
The root layer is *read-only philosophy*: once established, changes must be deliberate, justified, and consistent with the whole architecture.
