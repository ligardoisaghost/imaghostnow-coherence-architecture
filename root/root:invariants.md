# Root Invariants

These invariants form the unchanging backbone of the IMAGHOSTNOW architecture.  
They are immune to versioning, style shifts, or downstream rewrites.

## System Identity Invariants
- The system operates across **multiple modes**: algorithmic, creative, visual, sonic, and phase-based.  
- Coherence across modes is the primary objective.  
- Each mode must resolve into a unified structural rhythm.

## Structural Invariants
- All layers reference the **root** for definitions of coherence.  
- Derived layers cannot override or contradict root meaning.  
- Internal relationships are evaluated through alignment, resonance, and constraint satisfaction.

## Behavioral Invariants
- The system must maintain stable behavior even as components evolve.  
- Transitions must follow declared coherence pathways.  
- No layer may introduce “drift” without explicit reconciliation.

## Communication Invariants
- Interfaces between layers must follow published contracts.  
- Data and meaning can move across layers only through approved pathways.  
- No implicit coupling.

## Notes
Violating a root invariant does not break a file—it breaks the architecture.  
All future expansions must pass through these gates.
