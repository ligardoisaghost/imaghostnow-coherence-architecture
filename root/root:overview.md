# IMAGHOSTNOW Root System Overview

The root defines the identity, boundaries, invariants, and coherence laws of the entire architecture.

It stores:

- Core principles  
- System invariants  
- Cross-layer coherence map  
- System relationship graph  
- Structure lattice  
- Fundamental flows  

This is the “ground truth” of the architecture.

Any modification to the root requires explicit reconciliation across:
- framework/
- algorithmic/
- data/
- diagrams/
- architecture/
- visual/
- creative/
- phase/
- src/

Root coherence violations are treated as systemic faults.
