# Root System Overview

The root establishes the identity, boundaries, and governing coherence rules of the IMAGHOSTNOW system.  
Every other layer—algorithmic, creative, visual, phase, data—derives its stability and meaning from this foundation.

## Purpose
- Define the system’s non-negotiable coherence laws  
- Anchor long-scale identity across all modes  
- Provide the “ground truth” reference for every subsystem  
- Maintain structural integrity as the system evolves  
- Enforce boundaries so expansion never creates drift  

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Identity Source**  
   The central definition of what IMAGHOSTNOW is allowed to become.

2. **Boundary Map**  
   What is inside the system’s domain vs. what remains outside.

3. **Invariant Lattice**  
   Permanent rules that guarantee global coherence across time.

4. **Cross-Layer Anchor**  
   The reference point for aligning algorithmic, creative, visual, and phase logic.

5. **Stability Contracts**  
   Conditions that all layers must satisfy to remain part of the architecture.

- `structure.md` — The lattice, graph, and system map  
- `flows.md` (future file) — Canonical system flows and transitions  

## Notes
The root is the only layer that should **not drift** without a system-wide review.  
Changes propagate globally and must be treated with precision.
