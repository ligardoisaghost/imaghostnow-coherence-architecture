# Root Principles

These principles define how the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture is allowed to behave.  
They are treated as constitutional law, not suggestions.

## Core Principles

1. **Coherence First**  
   Every component, document, or dataset must strengthen or clarify coherence.  
   If it introduces noise without structure, it does not belong here.

2. **Cross-Layer Accountability**  
   No layer is isolated. Changes in one layer must be traceable to impacts in the others.

3. **Explicit Over Implicit**  
   Heuristics are allowed, hidden assumptions are not.  
   Any “gut feeling” rule must be written, versioned, and located.

4. **Reversibility**  
   Any architectural decision must be reversible with a clear rollback path.

5. **Instrumentation by Default**  
   If it cannot be observed, it cannot be trusted.  
   Flows, states, and transitions must be measurable in principle.

6. **Aligned Complexity**  
   Complexity is acceptable only when it increases explanatory power or control.  
   Decorative complexity is treated as technical debt.

## Cross-Layer Anchor

These principles bind:

- `framework/` (structural lattice)  
- `algorithmic/` (decision logic)  
- `data/` and `diagrams/` (evidence and maps)  
- `architecture/` (system design)  
- `visual/` and `creative/` (surface expression)  
- `phase/` (temporal state machine)  
- `src/` (actual implementations)
