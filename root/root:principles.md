# Root Principles

These are the non-negotiable rules that define the identity, logic, and integrity of the IMAGHOSTNOW system.

## Coherence Principles
1. **No contradiction across layers.**  
2. **Motion must match intention.**  
3. **Narrative must match behavior.**  
4. **Visual tone must match system phase.**  
5. **Algorithmic decisions must be explainable, auditable, and reproducible.**  
6. **Creative output must contain the signature of human instinct + machine clarity.**

## Behavioral Constraints
- No subsystem may override global coherence.  
- No shortcuts that degrade structural clarity.  
- No orphaned files, orphaned ideas, or untagged logic.  
- Every change must strengthen the architecture, not fragment it.

## Purpose
These principles are the compass for every future document, dataset, system expansion, or research extension.  
Break these, and the system collapses.  
Follow them, and the architecture becomes self-reinforcing.
