# Root Structure Map

The structure file defines how the entire architecture fits together.  
It establishes the lattice, the graph, the hierarchy, and the permitted pathways.

## System Lattice (High-Level)
- **Root**  
  Identity, invariants, coherence law  
- **Framework**  
  Structure, layers, and organizing principles  
- **Algorithmic**  
  Logic, flows, constraints  
- **Creative**  
  Narrative, motifs, semantic voice  
- **Visual**  
  Palette, metaphors, spatial coherence  
- **Phase**  
  Temporal states, cycles, transitions  
- **Data**  
  Schemas, pipelines, system observations  
- **Diagrams**  
  Maps of relationships and flows  
- **Docs**  
  Specifications and reference material  
- **Src**  
  Implementation, core builders  
- **Notes**  
  Working files, tasks, revisions  

## Relationship Graph
The system follows a **root-outward** coherence model:  
`Root → Framework → (Algorithmic / Creative / Visual / Phase) → Data / Diagrams → Docs → Src`

Each arrow is a permitted dependency.  
Reverse or diagonal dependencies must be justified.

## Pathways
- **Vertical pathways** ensure each layer inherits coherence from the one above.  
- **Horizontal pathways** allow communication between peer modes (e.g., creative ↔ visual) but only through defined interfaces.  
- **Temporal pathways** allow phase logic to influence or reconfigure lower-level behavior.

## Notes
The structure file acts as the architectural compass.  
Every new component must map cleanly into this lattice.
