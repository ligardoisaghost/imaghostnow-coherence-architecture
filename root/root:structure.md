# Root Structure

This document defines the architectural skeleton of the IMAGHOSTNOW Coherence Architecture.  
Everything above, below, or beside this layer inherits from these specifications.

## Global Architecture Model
The system is organized into layered domains:

1. **root/** — foundational rules, principles, invariants  
2. **framework/** — the generalized pattern model  
3. **phase/** — temporal and developmental sequencing  
4. **visual/** — imagery, archetypes, cinematic logic  
5. **algorithmic/** — machine behavior, pattern recognition, computational logic  
6. **creative/** — writing, film, sound, artistic output  
7. **papers/** — research outputs, academic writing  
8. **data/** — ingestion, logs, analytics, metrics  
9. **src/** — scripts, builders, tools

## Invariants
These cannot be violated:

- No subsystem may contradict root principles.  
- Each subsystem must map cleanly to the framework layer.  
- Phase rules define when a subsystem is active or dormant.  
- Visual, algorithmic, and creative branches must maintain coherence across tone, style, motion, and narrative.  
- Data and src layers must remain audit-friendly and reproducible.

## Structural Notes
The root structure is minimal but sovereign.  
Every major evolution of the architecture must begin here.
